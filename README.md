üìÅ Personal Git Repository Platform

A full-stack, self-hosted Git repository management system inspired by platforms like GitHub and Azure Repos. Built with Django and designed for teams that need robust version control, code collaboration, and repository hosting without the recurring costs of third-party services. This project showcases DevOps best practices, CI/CD integration, and aims to be used by the university's IT department as a cost-effective alternative to Azure DevOps.
